The player will select their desired language, and be presented with a scene containing objects to interact with. Depending on the mode of the game, lesson or quiz, the game will either explain the foreign name of the object or ask the player to pronounce it. The experience is fully VR immersive, meaning no interaction with any hardware besides wearables.\r\n\r\n##Oculingo Stack\r\nUnity: for Oculus Rift support. For displaying scenes and providing support for interaction.\r\nMicrophone: to understand user vocal input. Voice recognition will needs to support multiple languages\r\n\r\n##Structures and Design\r\nGameManager for handing flow of game\r\nTitleScene for introducing Oculingo, choosing mode and language\r\nStageScene for housing the Oculus camera and being the “stage” for each interactable object\r\nLanguageObject prefab for storing 3d model of an object, its various names in different languages, and state of interactable\r\nQuizMode to handle handling LanguageObjects interaction with camera, displaying goal prompt, playing audio prompt “StageScene.quiz(LanguageObject)” -> function uses native variable to construct a phrase to ask for the LanguageObject’s name in another language.\r\nLessonMode to handle handling LanguageObjects interaction with camera, playing audio prompt “StageScene.lesson(LanguageObject)” -> function uses native variable to construct a phrase to ask for the LanguageObject’s name in another language.\r\n\r\n##Sources\r\n* Unity Asset Store: Props for the Classroom\r\n* Open source vocal recognition: https://github.com/giyoonhan/UnityVoiceRecognition\r\n* TTS: http://www.chadweisshaar.com/blog/2015/07/02/microsoft-speech-for-unity/",
